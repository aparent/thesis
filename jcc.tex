\chapter{jcc}
jcc (Janus Circuit Compiler) is a compiler implemented for a modified version of the Janus programing language\cite{YG:2007}.
It's code is available at \url{https://github.com/aparent/jcc}.

The compiler targets quantum circuits.
\section{Implementation}
\subsection{Gate Set}

The gate set used by the compiler includes the NOT, CNOT, and Toffoli gates.

When choosing the implementation of various operations consideration is given to the expansion into the Clifford+T gate set. More specifically to the minimization of T-gates. For example shared controls on Toffoli gates are desired as they result in T cancellation.

\subsection{Addition}
Addition is done using the CDKM\cite{CDKM:2004} adder as shown below:

\verbatiminput{jcc-examples/add.j}

The final carry bit is not computed in this adder.
The result is an adder which computes $a+b \mod 2^n$

\subsection{Subtraction}
Subtraction can be done simply by reversing the addition circuit.

\subsection{Multiplication}
Multiplication is done with a simple shift and add circuit.
An adder adding the variables $a$ and $b$ consists of a CDKM\cite{CDKM:2004} adder controlled on each bit of a.
Each adder adds $b$ to some ancilla shifted left by the position of the control in a.
Each adder is smaller then the last as the multiplication is preformed $\mod 2^n$.
Below is an example of the compiler output for a multiplication:

\verbatiminput{jcc-examples/mult.j}

\subsection{Conditional Statements}
Conditional if-else branches can be evaluated by swapping the bits to the correct circuit path controlled on the if conditional. 
The other circuit path is evaluated on a set of ancilla bits is initialized to $H^{\otimes n}\ket{0}$.
Since this is an eigenvector of every permutation matrix it will be unchanged and can be cleaned up by reversing the initialization.

Note that the assertion is a statement about the state of the program which is true if and only if the ``if'' branch is taken rather then the ``else'' branch. 
This is useful as it describes a property of our data that can be used to clean up the bit used to store the result of the conditional. 
i.e. If we know that we took that if branch rather then the else branch we can XOR the conditional bit and be assured it is being reset to zero.
