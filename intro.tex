\chapter{Introduction}

The goal of this thesis is to describe a framework for the efficient compilation
of high-level programs into low level circuits.

\section{Reversible Computation}

When preforming computations information is regularly discarded. Actions such as
overwriting data cause many states to be mapped to one so even if one had
knowledge of the actions involved in a computation it may not be possible to
recover the initial state. These types of computations are called irreversible.

A reversible computation is a computation which preforms a 1-to-1 mapping
between states. In \cite{Bennett:73} Bennett showed that in principle any
computation could be made reversible (with a potentially large space overhead).

\section{Landauer's principle}

This principle states that any logical irreversible operation must be
accompanied by a corresponding entropy increase in non-information bearing
degrees of freedom\cite{bennett03}. Another way of stating this is that
an operation which does not preserve information must have an associated energy
cost. This can be understood through the second law of thermodynamics which
states that the entropy of a closed system cannot decrease.

The minimum bound on the amount of energy required to preform an irreversible
operation is called the Landauer limit ($kT\ln 2$).

Reversible computing avoids this minimum cost by ensuring that no information is
erased by the computation.

\section{Reversible Circuits}

Due to the focus on generation of circuits for use in quantum computation we
focus on the circuit model. The primary feature of the circuit model that makes
in useful in this setting is the fact that all operations are applied
unconditionally. This is important in the case of a quantum computer with
classical control since in order for  the classical part to make decisions about
which operations to apply which are dependent on data a measurement would have
to be made.

Consider a classical computation where we have inputs $a$, and $b$ and wish to
know the output $a\land b$.  The classical AND gate computes $(a,b)\mapsto
(a\land b)$, discarding the values of $a$ and $b$.  Since this function is not
injective (ex. $0\land 0 = 0$ and $1 \land 0 = 0$) it is not reversible.

One way to make it reversible is to use a Toffoli gate. The Toffoli gate
implements the injective function $(a,b,c) \mapsto (a,b,a\land b \oplus c)$. If
$c$ is initialized to zero we have $(a,b,0) \mapsto (a,b,a\land b)$. Note that
this means the values of $a$ and $b$ remain on the input bits after the
computation.

Any irreversible function can be made reversible using the ``Bennett
Method''\cite{Bennett:73}. In this method each irreversible gate is replaced
with a reversible version with additional space allocated as necessary. Then the
final result is copied out to newly allocated set of bits and the entire circuit
is repeated in reverse. So given an irreversible function $f(x)$ (where $f(x)$
is of size $n$) we can use the Bennett method to generate a reversible function
$(x,0^{n+m}) \mapsto (x,f(x),0^m)$.


\section{Quantum Circuits}

Analysis will be done using the Clifford plus T gate set.
This choice is made due it's availability in error correction schemes such as
the surface code\cites{}.\todo{Expand and mention the cost of state distillation
as motivation}

Long range interactions are assumed to be inexpensive in this model compared to
the cost of T gates.
